# blender-unreal-rig-utils

A lightweight Blender addon to instantly generate industry-standard **UE5 Manny** and **UE5 Quinn** armatures.
Built specifically for the Blender 5.0.1+ API using the modern Bone Collections system.

## Getting Started

The addon integrates seamlessly into the native Blender **Add** menu. By navigating to `Armature > Skeletons`,
users can choose between the UE5 Manny or UE5 Quinn skeletons. Alternatively, you can press `Shift + A` in
the 3D Viewport to access the new skeleton presets.
